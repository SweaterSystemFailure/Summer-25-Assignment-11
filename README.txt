Topics: Inheritance, method overriding, access control in class hierarchies

Description:
In this assignment, you'll create a class hierarchy representing different user roles in an inventory system. You will override a method called accessLevel() in each class to demonstrate how inheritance allows child classes to customize or extend parent behavior. This helps simulate real-world access control based on roles.
